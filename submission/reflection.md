# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
For this project, I mainly used ChatGPT to help me with coding problems and decision-making. It wasn’t just about getting answers but also I used it like a partner to genrate ideas, especially when I was stuck or unsure about how to approach a function. I also set up the hands-on-ai package with the granite3.2 model, which made it possible to generate live responses inside my weather app. This made the chatbot feel more real and showed how AI could be part of actual software.

## Prompting Techniques
I tried to be really intentional with how I used AI. Before asking for code, I would often explain what I was trying to do in my own words so the AI could understand my thinking. I also asked for pseudocode first to help me plan, and then moved on to actual implementation. I checked how the AI handled edge cases too, like what happens if a user doesn’t enter a location. I think treating AI as a teammate instead of just copying code helped me understand things better and build more solid features.

## What Worked Well?
I’m genuinely proud of how the chatbot turned out. It’s simple but it works. Users can ask about the weather in plain English and get a sensible answer back as well as I added graphs that make it visually useful too. From someone who doesn’t come from a technical background, this felt like a big achievement. I also kept my code clean and modular, which I know is something developers care about in the real world.

## What Would You Do Differently?
If I had more time, I would improve the natural language parser to handle more flexible questions. Right now, it only recognises a few cities and keywords, so something like fuzzy matching would make it more user-friendly. I’d also consider saving search history or adding more cities to compare forecasts.

## Final Thoughts
Before this unit, I honestly felt nervous around code. But this assignment showed me that with AI and the right mindset and I can actually build things that work and even look professional. This wasn’t just a uni project for me rather it was proof that I can learn and create something real, even without a tech background. That feels good.
