Me: I want to structure my notebook for a full-mark submission. The rubric requires clean section headers, modular design, and testing.

AI: Split the notebook into these markdown-labeled sections:
1. Setup & Imports
2. Weather Data Functions
3. Visualisation
4. NLP Parsing
5. Response Generation
6. User Interface
7. Testing Section

Me: Should I put each function in its own cell?

AI: Yes. Group related functions in one cell. Add clear comments and docstrings. Also:
- Add `# üîÅ Main Application Logic`
- Use `pyinputplus` for UI
- Include a test cell that runs one full use case

Me: Got it. This will help the markers follow my logic too. Thanks!
