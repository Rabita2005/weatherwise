Me: I want to let users ask natural language questions like “Will it rain in Perth?” or “What’s the temperature in Sydney?” How do I parse these?

AI: Start by extracting two key things:
- Location
- Attribute (e.g., temperature or rain)

Me: Can you show pseudocode?

AI:
```python
def parse_question(q):
    for word in known_weather_keywords:
        if word in q:
            attribute = word
    for city in known_cities:
        if city in q:
            location = city
    return {"location": location, "attribute": attribute}
```

Me: Should I lowercase the question first?

AI: Yes! Always lowercase input before matching keywords:
```python
q = q.lower()
```

Me: Any edge cases to watch for?

AI: Yes:
- No location found → return a default or error
- Invalid spelling → consider fuzzy matching (future upgrade)
