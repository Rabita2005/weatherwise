Me: My bot sometimes returns weird answers like “Today is sunny” even if it's raining. What can I do?

AI: Make sure you're using the right index. For example:
```python
desc = data["weather"][0]["hourly"][0]["weatherDesc"][0]["value"]
```

Me: I was using the wrong hour, I think. Can I show the full forecast in the chatbot response?

AI: You can loop through days:
```python
for day in data["weather"]:
    print(day["date"], day["maxtempC"])
```
Or summarise just today:
```python
today = data["weather"][0]
temp = today["maxtempC"]
desc = today["hourly"][0]["weatherDesc"][0]["value"]
```

Me: Makes sense. I’ll clean it up to show only one day in chatbot for now.
