# 🌦️ WeatherWise – Intelligent Weather Analysis App

Welcome to **WeatherWise**, an AI-assisted Python application designed to provide accurate, insightful, and interactive weather forecasts. Built by a Rabita Sami, this project showcases modular coding, data visualisation, and conversational AI integration.

---

## Features

-  Real-time weather data using the **wttr.in API**
-  Multiple visualisations:
  - Max/Min Temperature Trends
  - Daily Rainfall Forecast
  - Humidity Levels at Midday
-  Natural Language Interface:
  - Ask questions like "Will it rain in Sydney?" or "How hot will it be in Hanoi?"
-  Testing Function:
  - Built-in diagnostics to validate key components
-  Built using intentional AI prompting and iterative design

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- `requests` – HTTP calls to weather API
- `matplotlib` – Visualisation
- `pyinputplus` – User-friendly menus
- `hands-on-ai` – AI chat interface
- `fetch-my-weather` (optional) – For alternative data access

---

## How to Run (Google Colab Recommended)

1. Open the `starter_notebook.ipynb` in **Google Colab**.
2. Run the first cell to install any required packages (if not pre-installed).
3. Click **Run All** or follow the notebook section by section.
4. Choose options from the **WeatherWise Menu**:
   - View forecasts and visualisations
   - Ask questions via the AI chatbot
   - Run built-in test suite

## Folder Structure

- `starter_notebook.ipynb` — Main application notebook
- `submission/`
  - `reflection.md` — My personal reflection
  - `checklist.md` — Submission checklist
- `ai-conversations/`
  - `conversation1.txt` to `conversation5.txt` — Documented AI development logs
- `README.md` — Project overview

## AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT** 
- Used to:
  - Explore design decisions
  - Generate/refactor code
  - Improve chatbot logic
  - Add visualisation enhancements

Prompting techniques included:
- Restating problems
- Pseudocode before implementation
- Iterative feedback loops
- Querying edge cases and usability

---

## Example Questions to Try

- “What’s the temperature in Perth today?”
- “Will it rain in Sydney tomorrow?”
- “Is it humid in Hanoi?”

##  Final Notes

This project demonstrates how i without a tech background can build a practical, intelligent weather tool using Python and AI guidance. The entire process—from planning to execution—was shaped through intentional prompting, critical thinking, and creative iteration.

Enjoy using WeatherWise!
